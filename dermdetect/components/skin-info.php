            This application is developed to accurately differentiate between seven different skin lesions.
            The fundamental objective is to provide healthcare providers and individuals with a powerful and efficient
            tool that can aid in the fast and accurate detection of skin cancer.

            <b>a. Melanoma (MEL): </b>often characterized as the most fatal form of skin cancer. 
            It is a malignant illness that generally destroys melanocytes cells, 
            which are cells that secrete melanin pigment, giving the skin its characteristic color. 
            Common symptoms include the formation of brown or black spots.

        <div class="derm-item">
            <b>b. Melanocytic nevi (NV): </b>are benign pigmented moles that typically manifest as brown to black pigmented lesions that are either elevated or flat.

        <div class="derm-item">
            <b>c. Benign-like keratosis (BKL): </b>
            this is a non-cancerous medical disorder that can impact your skin, nails, hair, and mucous membranes. 
            It occurs when the body's immune system targets cells without a clear cause. 
            Symptoms include growth over time, resulting in discomfort and swelling in the affected region.

            <b>d. Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma (AKIEC): </b>
            are premalignant abnormal skin growths that occur within the layer of cells that makes up an organ's lining or surface. 
            It is caused by the abnormal growth of cell population owing to the division or reproduction of keratinocytes. 
            Individuals suffering with actinic keratosis may exhibit irregular, red, plaques or scaly papules on sun-exposed areas of the body.

            <b>f. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC): </b>is a prevalent type of skin cancer. 
            It is caused by the aberrant and uncontrolled growth of basal cells on the outermost layer of skin. 
            Some of the common symptoms associated with BCC include: scars, glossy lumps, red spots, pink growths, or open sores.

            <b>g. Dermatofibroma (DF): </b>is a common skin lesion that is typically located in the dermis of the skin. It is also referred to as benign fibrous histiocytomas of the skin. They are often asymptomatic and have a diameter of less than or equal to one centimeter.
